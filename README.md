# Why I do this?

" I want to understand the maths behind the machine learning algorithms and I want to implement them from scratch. "

# What I do?

This is a repository for my personal learning of machine learning algorithms. I will implement the algorithms from scratch and try to understand the maths behind them. I will also try to implement the algorithms in different programming languages.

# What I have done?

I have done some classes for creating a neural network.

# How to use it?

... to be continued
